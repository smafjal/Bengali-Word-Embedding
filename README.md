# Bengali-Word-Embedding
------------------------------
## WHAT?
**Word embedding** is a language modeling and feature learning techniques in *Natural Language Processing(NLP)*.<br>
It can represent every word or phrase as a set of numbers or like i say a real valued vector.<br>
As each word has a real valued vector,it's easy to apply many machine learning method in NLP task.<br>

Bengali-Word-Embedding is done by using *word2vec* language model.
*worde2vec* is a neural-networks based model designed by google.<br>
If you want to know about word2vec try [google word2vec](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).
Want to know about *How does word2vec work ?* try [quora-how] (https://www.quora.com/How-does-word2vec-work) <br>

## WHY?
Word Embedding can be used in many NLP task in Bengali language. A short lists is given below ---<br>

1. Words Simililarity
2. Parts of Speech Tag
3. News/Documents Classification
4. News/Documents Clustaring
5. Sentiment Analysis
6. Name Entity Recognition

## HOW ?

###### install dependency
I used gensim library. Gensim is a python based machine learning library.To install it try it from [here](http://junya906.blogspot.com/2015/10/install-gensim-on-ubuntu-1404.html) or their official site.

###### bd word embedding_train.py
This file is used for train a model.Our corpus folder is *bd_corpus* , model saved on *bd_save_model* <br>
To generate word vector---- change in *output_test(model,path)* function<br>
**On terminal run:** 
>python bd_word_embedding_train.py
    
###### bd word embedding_retrain.py
Think a situation like you trained a model by using some corpus-data.But after that some new data are added for embedding.<br>
One soluation is to run the model again by giving all data on model [time consumming].<br>
Second soluation is to train the model by loading saved model and retrain model by giving only new data.<br>
This file can be done the second soluation for you.You just have to change the *bd_corpus_path* and give the *saved_model_path*<br>
**On terminal run:** 
>python bd_word_embedding_retrain.py
    


##THEN?
To know, is to know that you know nothing.<br>
That is the meaning of true knowledge.<br>
